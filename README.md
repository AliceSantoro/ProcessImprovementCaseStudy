IT process transformation at Collegio Einaudi
# Collegio Einaudi Process Transformation

## Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and transformation proposal for the Fondazione Collegio Universitario di Torino Renato Einaudi, focusing on improving the laundry management process. The project follows an "As-Is/To-Be" methodology, analyzing the current state of operations and proposing practical improvements aligned with the organization's goals and values.

## Academic Context
This work was developed as a final project for the Information Systems course at Politecnico di Torino. The project applied theoretical concepts from the course to analyze a real organization and propose IT-driven process improvements.

## Organization Background
Collegio Universitario di Torino Renato Einaudi is a non-profit educational institution that manages university residences in Turin, Italy. The organization aims to enhance the merit and potential of motivated university students by providing them with accommodations and educational opportunities in a stimulating learning environment.

## Problem Statement
The current laundry management process at Collegio Einaudi relies on manual Excel forms for bookings and requires students to retrieve tokens from doormen during limited hours. This process is inefficient, prone to data inconsistency, and does not align with the organization's goal of improving students' quality of life.

## Proposed Solution
The project proposes key changes to improve efficiency and user experience:

1. **Reservation Application**: Implementation of Calendly to replace the Excel booking system
2. **Token Dispenser**: Introduction of an automated token dispenser with badge reader
3. **Notification System**: Automated notifications when laundry cycles complete

## Repository Contents
- **As-Is Analysis**: Detailed examination of current organizational structure, processes, and IT infrastructure
- **To-Be Model**: Proposed changes, including process redesigns and new technology integration
- **BPMN Diagrams**: Visual representations of current and proposed processes
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: TCO, ROI and break-even calculations for the proposed changes
- **Change Management Plan**: Strategy for implementing changes with minimal disruption

## Business Value
The proposed changes offer several benefits:
- Improved reliability of the reservation system
- Reduced waiting time for students
- Elimination of data inconsistency issues
- Positive ROI with break-even achieved within 4 years
- Alignment with organizational goal of enhancing student life quality

## Implementation Timeline
The implementation plan includes a 2-week transition period with doorman support to help students adapt to the new system and ensure proper functioning of the token dispenser.
